A Shiny R application to disambiguate authors.


Author Disambiguation 
========================================================
Author disambiguation has been a challenge in the last couple of years. With the increasing number of publications in the scientific scene and the different format of publishing the names of the authors, the problem challenge arose in being able to identify all articles or papers written by a specific author who wrote a specific paper.


Application
========================================================
To address this challenge, we have developed an algorithm that compares a specific author and article with all the other ones existing in publications in the database which could possible be the same. 

How does it work?
========================================================
User Guide:

1. The enters the author and article title in the fields.
2. The applications runs a predictive model in order to compare with this author with the others in the dataset.
3. The application outputs the list of other articles which are probably written by the same author.
